# Toy Project
## Problem Statement
Define which problem you solved with your project.
Automatic Number plate Recognition and Detection .
The main focus in this project is to experiment deeply with, and find
alternative solutions to the image segmentation and character recognition problems
within the License Plate Recognition framework. Three main stages are identified in
such applications. 
First, it is necessary to locate and extract the license plate region from a larger
scene image. Second, having a license plate region to work with, the alphanumeric
characters in the plate need to be extracted from the background. Third, deliver
them to an OCR system for recognition.

## Learning Process
Decribe which tools you used within the learning phase and how you achieved to build your project. Additionally, formulate what you have learning during this project.
I used python , jupyter notebook , OpenCV  and tensorflow 
I learned how to detect license plate from images and in real time from video and how to apply OCR to license  plate to extreact the plate number also I learned how to save license plates detected for future analysis and searching

# Coding Competition
## Problem Statement 
There have been several advancements in technology and a lot of research has been done to help the people who are deaf and dumb. Aiding the cause, Deep learning, and computer vision can be used too to make an impact on this cause.
Arabic Sign Language Recognation can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb people in communicating with others as knowing sign language is not something that is common to all.
The aim of the Arabic sign language recogniation is to ptovide an accurate and convenient mechanism to trascibe the signs into meaningful text or speech that communication betseen deaf and hearning society can easily be made.
